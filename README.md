# Air_Quality_Index_Dashboard
I'm excited to share my latest project—an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, 
visualizing real-time air pollution data across Indian cities and states. 🌫️✨

🔍 About the Project
 Using the "Real Time Air Quality Index" dataset from the Government of India’s open data platform, 
 I transformed raw data into a dynamic and insightful Excel dashboard. The aim was to analyze air pollution patterns, 
 identify the most and least polluted areas, and break down pollutant contributions with intuitive visuals.

📌 Key Features of the Dashboard:
🏙️ City & State Filters for tailored insights
⚠️ National AQI Metrics: Average, Maximum, Minimum
📊 Top 10 Most Polluted Cities bar chart
🗺️ State-wise AQI Heat Map using Bing Maps integration
🍩 Pollutant Composition by City and Overall Pollutant Share using donut & pie charts
📈 City-wise AQI Distribution for comparative analysis

⚙️ Excel Tools & Techniques Used:
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
Slicers for real-time filtering
Conditional formatting
Data validation and dynamic charting
Geographic visualization using map charts
