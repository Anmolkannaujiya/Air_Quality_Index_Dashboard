# Air_Quality_Index_Dashboard
I'm excited to share my latest project—an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, 
visualizing real-time air pollution data across Indian cities and states. 🌫️✨

🔍 About the Project
 Using the "Real Time Air Quality Index" dataset from the Government of India’s open data platform, 
 I transformed raw data into a dynamic and insightful Excel dashboard. The aim was to analyze air pollution patterns, 
 identify the most and least polluted areas, and break down pollutant contributions with intuitive visuals.
